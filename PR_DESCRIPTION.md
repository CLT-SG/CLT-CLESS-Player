## Feature: Mobile Image Base64 Data URL Implementation

Implements base64 data URL handling for images in mobile CMS player, fixing display issues that did not occur in Electron desktop version.

## Problems Fixed

Images failed to display reliably in mobile player while working perfectly in Electron desktop app:
1. Native URI approach inconsistent - convertFileSrc generated URIs failed on some Android devices
2. Platform differences - Electron direct file access vs Capacitor asynchronous file operations
3. URI scheme compatibility - Different Android versions handled file URIs differently
4. Synchronous vs async - Electron synchronous operations vs mobile asynchronous requirements
5. Missing fallback strategy - No base64 data URL option for images when native URIs failed

Evidence from testing showed:
- Images displayed in Electron desktop app but failed in mobile app
- Native URIs worked for videos but unreliable for images
- convertFileSrc URIs sometimes inaccessible to img elements
- Different behavior across Android device manufacturers
- No consistent solution using native URI approach for images

## Changes Made

1. Added getMimeTypeFromExtension helper method for correct MIME type mapping
2. Implemented _performImageDownload method for image-specific base64 handling
3. Implemented _performVideoDownload method separating video logic from images
4. Modified _performDownload to route images and videos to appropriate handlers
5. Updated getMediaUri to return base64 data URLs for images
6. Updated getMediaUri to continue using native URIs for videos
7. Modified refreshMediaUri with type-aware URI generation logic
8. Updated module documentation describing dual-strategy approach
9. Maintained backward compatibility with fallback support
10. Preserved all existing video handling functionality

## Technical Implementation

Dual-Strategy Media Handling:
- Images use base64 data URLs for reliable cross-platform display
- Videos use native URIs for efficient streaming without memory overhead
- Type detection based on file extension (jpg, jpeg, png, gif, webp, bmp, svg)
- Automatic routing in _performDownload method

Image Download Flow:
- Download image as blob from server
- Write blob to filesystem using Capacitor Filesystem API
- Read back as base64 using readFile with encoding: 'base64'
- Build data URL: data:image/{mime};base64,{base64data}
- Cache data URL in memory for instant access
- Compatible with img elements: img.src = dataUrl

Video Download Flow (Unchanged):
- Download video as blob from server
- Write to filesystem as binary
- Get native file URI using getUri()
- Convert to web-accessible URI using convertFileSrc()
- Cache converted URI for instant playback
- Compatible with VideoJS and video elements

MIME Type Mapping:
- getMimeTypeFromExtension maps extensions to proper MIME types
- jpg/jpeg maps to image/jpeg
- png maps to image/png
- gif maps to image/gif
- webp maps to image/webp
- Proper MIME types ensure correct browser rendering

URI Cache Strategy:
- Images: Base64 data URLs stored in uriCache
- Videos: Native converted URIs stored in uriCache
- Type-aware cache invalidation on refresh
- Backward compatible with existing fallback support

## Files Changed Summary

Modified Files:
- mobile/www/assets/js/mobile/mobile-media-manager.js - Implemented dual-strategy media handling with base64 for images (320 lines changed)

New Files:
- mobile/docs_mobile/IMAGE-BASE64-IMPLEMENTATION.md - Comprehensive technical documentation with usage examples

## Impact

User Experience:
- Images display reliably across all Android versions
- No URI scheme compatibility issues
- Matches Electron desktop app behavior
- Instant rendering after initial cache
- Videos maintain efficient streaming performance
- No memory issues with large media files

Technical:
- Clear separation between image and video handling
- Images optimized for reliability using base64 data URLs
- Videos optimized for performance using native URIs
- Type-specific optimizations based on media requirements
- Maintains backward compatibility with fallback support
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
- Professional code structure with clear documentation

## Testing

Test image and video display in mobile app:
- Import various image formats (JPG, PNG, GIF, WebP) via Import Media button
- Download images from CMS server in media slots
- Verify images display correctly in all slot types
- Import video files (MP4, WebM) to confirm no regression
- Play videos in media slots to verify streaming works
- Check console logs show base64 data URL creation for images
- Verify native URI generation continues for videos

Verification commands:
- window.mediaManager.uriCache should show data URLs for images (data:image/jpeg;base64,...)
- window.mediaManager.uriCache should show native URIs for videos (capacitor://localhost/...)
- Console logs should show "Loading IMAGE as base64" for images
- Console logs should show "Starting VIDEO download" for videos
- Check image src attributes contain base64 data URLs
- Check video src attributes contain native URIs

## Compatibility

- Android 5.0+ with Capacitor WebView
- iOS 13.0+ with Capacitor support
- Requires Capacitor Filesystem 6.0.1+ (already installed)
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
- Backward compatible with all configurations
- Works with existing fallback mechanisms
- No additional dependencies required
